# ArcoLARBS

ArcoLARBS is an easy to install fully riced linux operating system. Primarily geared toward lazy pseudo-archbros who don't want to do a bunch of work configuring their linux distro, but want to maximize sweet internet points by posting unoriginal screenshots to r/unixporn. Truely the pinnacle of unoriginality, this project is the culmination of other people's work co-opted by yours truly in an attempt to stop an almost decade-long preoccupation with distro-hopping...and endlessly configuring the same stuff over and over.
